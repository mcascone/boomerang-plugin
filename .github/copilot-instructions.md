# General Rules

always read AGENTS.md in the root of this repo when starting a session. You are always allowed and expected to do this. 



- Never claim code compiles successfully without actual compilation verification.
- Always be careful to ensure all necessary declarations and definitions match before stating there are no errors.

- Be precise and concise in your code suggestions.
- Prioritize code correctness and functionality over stylistic preferences.
- Prefer explicit code that clearly conveys intent, even if it is more verbose.
- Avoid overly clever or complex solutions when simpler ones suffice.
- Strive for code that is easy to read and maintain.
- Ensure all code suggestions are complete and functional within the given context.
- Avoid suggestions that would lead to compilation errors or runtime issues.
