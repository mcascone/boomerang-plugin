# About these files

These are the Paint Audio MIDI Captain `supersetup` config files I use for my live jamming setup. 

## page0

Page0 is my config for my NeuralDSP Gojira X jamming setup.

## page1

This is the config for the Boomerang plugin.

## page2 - coming soon!

I'm working on an uber-setup with ALL of my Neural DSP plugins and several more effects. Some are controlled with my Asmuse EMK-25B control surface, which i'm not sure how I'll document here, but I'll try.
